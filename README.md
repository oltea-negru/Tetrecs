Designed, implemented, and tested Java and JavaFX code in an advanced GUI game application resembling Tetris.

Enabled a fast-paced block placing environment with preview of future pieces to be placed as well as the possibility 
of rotating or swapping them as part of my Programming II coursework graded 83/100.

Here is a short video of me playing it. Enjoy!
